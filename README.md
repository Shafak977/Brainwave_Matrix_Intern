Projects Overview
This repository contains two projects developed during my internship at Brainwave Matrix Solutions: a Library Management System and a Movie Rental System. Both projects aim to streamline operations, enhance user experience, and provide efficient data management solutions.

Task 1: Library Management System
Overview
The Library Management System is designed to manage the operations of a library, including tracking books, managing member information, and handling book loans. The system provides an efficient way to manage library resources and improve the overall user experience for both librarians and members.

Loan Tracking: Track book loans, including loan dates, return dates, and due dates.

Search Functionality: Search for books and members using various criteria.

Reporting: Generate reports on book availability, overdue loans, and member activity.

Conclusion
Both projects provided valuable experience in database design, SQL query development, and data management. They demonstrate my ability to create efficient systems that meet user needs and improve operational efficiency. I look forward to applying the skills and knowledge gained from these projects in future endeavors.
